excerpt: "Open source software is eating the world. What is eating it from the inside?"

### Collectiive?
The open source movement is at an inflection point. The number, popularity, and usage of open source software is at an historic high; but the fundamental sustainability of the movement is shaky at best, non-existent at worst.

**Collectiive** is a collaborative public effort to search for answers to questions vital to the sustainability of open source.

### Questions
- **Can we make the open-source movement self-sustaining?**
Open source survives on philanthropy: the altruism of the initiator of an open source project, the unpaid labour of the maintainer and the individual contributor, and the monetary donations to foundations which support open source projects. Is there an alternative, self-sustaining way?

- **Can we pay back for the effort of the maintainer and the individual contributor?**

- **How can an entity be incentivised to give back a portion of the value it captures from an open source software back to the open source community?**
